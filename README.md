# FourierSketcher

# TODO
# General:
- WORKERS! STOP FREEZING ON ME FIREFOX!!
# ImageProcessing:
- DONE Check recursion resets work fine
- DONE Function for setting pixels in img data (awfully lot of repeated code)
- Travelling Salesman: heuristic for along gradient lines?
- FIx sampling, currently duplicates some of the left of the image due to division into non-precise partitions?

# Fourier
- Implement FFT.
- Dont draw vectors smaller than can bee seen (1 px or less)
- Fix small visual artefacts from pointer starting in top left?

# Export
- Framerate: points per second. Can use n points and framerate to calculate playback duration
